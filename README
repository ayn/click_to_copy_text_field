ClickToCopyTextfield
====================

click textfield to copy to clipboard, note that this plugin requires jQuery (or jrails).

This uses the Clipboard 2.0 jQuery plugin [http://plugins.jquery.com/project/clipboard]

This probably won't work with Flash 10 as Adobe has changed permissions in Flash.

Example
=======

in your view or layout, include the javascript:
<%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery.clipboard.pack.js' %>

and then do something like this:
<%= click_to_copy_text_field_tag 'share-link-1', "http://some_link", :size => 10 %>
